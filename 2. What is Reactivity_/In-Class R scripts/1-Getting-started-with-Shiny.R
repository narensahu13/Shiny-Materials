#####   GETTING STARTED with SHINY   ##### 
##########################################

## EXAMPLE #1
## Hello Shiny !

# The Hello Shiny example is a simple 
# application that generates a random 
# distribution with a configurable number 
# of observations and then plots it. 

# To run the example, type:
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")

# Shiny applications have two components: 
# a user-interface definition and 
# a server script. 

# The source code for both of these 
# components is listed below.

# The user interface is defined in a 
# source file named ui.R

##########################################
### Hello Shiny Example ui.R:

# library(shiny)

## Define UI for application that plots random distributions 
#shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  
#  # Application title
#  headerPanel("Hello Shiny!"),
  
#  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of observations
#  sidebarPanel(
#    sliderInput("obs", 
#                "Number of observations:", 
#                min = 0, 
#                max = 1000, 
#                value = 500)
#  ),
  
#  # Show a plot of the generated distribution
#  mainPanel(
#    plotOutput("distPlot")
#  )
#))
##########################################

# The server-side of the application is 
# shown below. At one level, it's very 
# simple-a random distribution with the 
# requested number of observations is 
# generated, and then plotted as a 
# histogram. However, you'll also notice 
# that the function which returns the plot 
# is wrapped in a call to renderPlot.

########################################
### Hello Shiny Example server.R

#library(shiny)

## Define server logic required to generate and plot a random distribution
#shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  
#  # Expression that generates a plot of the distribution. The expression
#  # is wrapped in a call to renderPlot to indicate that:
#  #
#  #  1) It is "reactive" and therefore should be automatically 
#  #     re-executed when inputs change
#  #  2) Its output type is a plot 
#  #
#  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    
#    # generate an rnorm distribution and plot it
#    dist <- rnorm(input$obs)
#    hist(dist)
#  })
#})
##########################################

# The next example will show the use of more
# input controls, as well as the use of 
# reactive functions to generate textual 
# output.


## EXAMPLE #2
## Shiny Text

# The Shiny Text application demonstrates 
# printing R objects directly, as well as 
# displaying data frames using HTML tables. 

# To run the example, type:

runExample("02_text")

# If you try changing the number of 
# observations to another value, you'll 
# see a demonstration of one of the most 
# important attributes of Shiny applications: 
# inputs and outputs are connected together
# "live" and changes are propagated 
# immediately (like a spreadsheet). 

# In this case, rather than the entire 
# page being reloaded, just the table view 
# is updated when the number of observa-
# tions change.

# Here is the user interface definition for 
# the application. Notice in particular 
# that the sidebarPanel and mainPanel 
# functions are now called with two 
# arguments (corresponding to the two 
# inputs and two outputs displayed):

###########################################
### Shiny Text Example ui.R:

# library(shiny)

## Define UI for dataset viewer application
#shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  
#  # Application title
#  headerPanel("Shiny Text"),
  
#  # Sidebar with controls to select a dataset and specify the number
#  # of observations to view
#  sidebarPanel(
#    selectInput("dataset", "Choose a dataset:", 
#                choices = c("rock", "pressure", "cars")),
    
#    numericInput("obs", "Number of observations to view:", 10)
#  ),
  
#  # Show a summary of the dataset and an HTML table with the requested
#  # number of observations
#  mainPanel(
#    verbatimTextOutput("summary"),
    
#    tableOutput("view")
#  )
#))
###########################################

# The server side of the application has 
# also gotten a bit more complicated. Now 
# we create:

# 1) A reactive expression to return the 
# dataset corresponding to the user choice
# 
# 2) Two other rendering expressions 
# (renderPrint and renderTable) that 
# return the output$summary and output$view
# values

# These expressions work similarly to the 
# renderPlot expression used in the first 
# example: by declaring a rendering 
# expression you tell Shiny that it should 
# only be executed when its dependencies 
# change. 

# In this case that's either one of the 
# user input values (input$dataset or 
# input$obs). BUT changing input$obs ONLY
# causes changes to the table view (output$view)

###########################################
## Shiny Text Example server.R

#library(shiny)
#library(datasets)

## Define server logic required to summarize and view the selected dataset
#shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  
#  # Return the requested dataset
#  datasetInput <- reactive({
#    switch(input$dataset,
#           "rock" = rock,
#           "pressure" = pressure,
#           "cars" = cars)
#  })
  
#  # Generate a summary of the dataset
#  output$summary <- renderPrint({
#    dataset <- datasetInput()
#    summary(dataset)
#  })
  
#  # Show the first "n" observations
#  output$view <- renderTable({
#    head(datasetInput(), n = input$obs)
#  })
#})
###########################################

# We've introduced more use of reactive 
# expressions but haven't really explained 
# how they work yet. 

# The next example will start with this 
# one as a baseline and expand significantly 
# on how reactive expressions work in Shiny.


## EXAMPLE #3
## Reactivity

# The Reactivity application is very similar 
# to Hello Text, but goes into much more 
# detail about reactive programming concepts.

# To run the example, type:

runExample("03_reactivity")

# The previous examples have given you a good 
# idea of what the code for Shiny applications 
# looks like. We've explained a bit about 
# reactivity, but mostly glossed over details. 

# In this section, we explore these concepts 
# more carefully. 

## WHAT IS REACTIVITY?

# The Shiny web framework is fundamentally 
# about making it easy to wire up input 
# values from a web page, making them easily 
# available to you in R, and have the results
# of your R code be written as output values 
# back out to the web page.

# That is:
# input values => R code => output values

# Since Shiny web apps are interactive, the 
# input values can change at any time, and 
# the output values need to be updated 
# immediately to reflect those changes.

# Shiny comes with a reactive programming 
# library that you will use to structure 
# your application logic. By using this 
# library, changing input values will 
# naturally cause the right parts of your 
# R code to be reexecuted, which will in 
# turn cause any changed outputs to be 
# updated.

## BASICS OF REACTIVE PROGRAMMING

# Reactive programming is a coding style that
# starts with 

# 1) reactive values: values that change over
# time, or in response to the user-and builds
# on top of them with 

# 2) reactive expressions: expressions that 
# access reactive values and execute other 
# reactive expressions.

# Dependency Tracking in Reactive Programming

# What's interesting about reactive expressions 
# is that whenever they execute, they 
# automatically keep track of what reactive 
# values they read and what reactive expressions 
# they invoked. 

# If those "dependencies" become out of date,
# then they know that their own return value 
# has also become out of date. Because of this
# dependency tracking, changing a reactive 
# value will automatically instruct all 
# reactive expressions that directly or 
# indirectly depended on that value to 
# re-execute.

# The most common way you'll encounter reactive 
# values in Shiny is using the input object. 
# The input object, which is passed to your 
# shinyServer function, lets you access the 
# web page's user input fields using a list-like
# syntax. Code-wise, it looks like you're 
# grabbing a value from a list or data frame, 
# but you're actually reading a reactive value. 

# No need to write code to monitor when inputs 
# change-just write reactive expression that 
# read the inputs they need, and let Shiny take 
# care of knowing when to call them.

# It's simple to create reactive expression: 
# just pass a normal expression into reactive().

# In this example app, an example of that is 
# the expression that returns an R data frame 
# based on the selection the user made in the 
# input form:

datasetInput <- reactive({
switch(input$dataset,
       "rock" = rock,
       "pressure" = pressure,
       "cars" = cars)
})

# To turn reactive values into outputs that can 
# viewed on the web page, we assigned them to 
# the output object (also passed to the 
# shinyServer function). Here is an example of 
# an assignment to an output that depends on 
# both the datasetInput reactive expression we 
# just defined, as well as input$obs:
output <- list()

output$view <- renderTable({
  head(datasetInput(), n = input$obs)
})

# This expression will be re-executed (and its 
# output re-rendered in the browser) whenever 
# either the datasetInput or input$obs value 
# changes.

### Back to the third Example

# Now that we've taken a deeper loop at some 
# of the core concepts, let's revisit the source
# code and try to understand what's going on in 
# more depth. The user interface definition has 
# been updated to include a text-input field 
# that defines a caption. Other than that it's 
# very similar to the previous example

###############################################
## Reactivity Example ui.R
# library(shiny)

## Define UI for dataset viewer application
#shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  
#  # Application title
#  headerPanel("Reactivity"),
  
#  # Sidebar with controls to provide a caption, select a dataset, and 
#  # specify the number of observations to view. Note that changes made
#  # to the caption in the textInput control are updated in the output
#  # area immediately as you type
#  sidebarPanel(
#    textInput("caption", "Caption:", "Data Summary"),
    
#    selectInput("dataset", "Choose a dataset:", 
#                choices = c("rock", "pressure", "cars")),
    
#    numericInput("obs", "Number of observations to view:", 10)
#  ),
  
  
#  # Show the caption, a summary of the dataset and an HTML table with
#  # the requested number of observations
#  mainPanel(
#    h3(textOutput("caption")), 
    
#    verbatimTextOutput("summary"), 
    
#    tableOutput("view")
#  )
#))
###############################################

## Server Script
# The server script declares the datasetInput 
# reactive expression as well as three reactive 
# output values. There are detailed comments 
# for each definition that describe how it works
# within the reactive system

###############################################
## Reactivity Example server.R
# library(shiny)
library(datasets)

# Define server logic required to summarize and view the selected dataset
#shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  
#  # By declaring datasetInput as a reactive expression we ensure that:
#  #
#  #  1) It is only called when the inputs it depends on changes
#  #  2) The computation and result are shared by all the callers (it 
#  #     only executes a single time)
#  #  3) When the inputs change and the expression is re-executed, the
#  #     new result is compared to the previous result; if the two are
#  #     identical, then the callers are not notified
#  #
#  datasetInput <- reactive({
#    switch(input$dataset,
#           "rock" = rock,
#           "pressure" = pressure,
#           "cars" = cars)
#  })
  
#  # The output$caption is computed based on a reactive expression that
#  # returns input$caption. When the user changes the "caption" field:
#  #
#  #  1) This expression is automatically called to recompute the output 
#  #  2) The new caption is pushed back to the browser for re-display
#  # 
#  # Note that because the data-oriented reactive expression below don't 
#  # depend on input$caption, those expression are NOT called when 
#  # input$caption changes.
#  output$caption <- renderText({
#    input$caption
#  })
  
#  # The output$summary depends on the datasetInput reactive expression, 
#  # so will be re-executed whenever datasetInput is re-executed 
#  # (i.e. whenever the input$dataset changes)
#  output$summary <- renderPrint({
#    dataset <- datasetInput()
#    summary(dataset)
#  })
  
#  # The output$view depends on both the databaseInput reactive expression
#  # and input$obs, so will be re-executed whenever input$dataset or 
#  # input$obs is changed. 
#  output$view <- renderTable({
#    head(datasetInput(), n = input$obs)
#  })
#})
